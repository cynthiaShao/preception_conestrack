## Answer Image
The false_answer image is attached below, and the program code also write a picture in the same directory as the cones_detect file.

## Methodology
When I saw this image I first thought of detecting the triangles in the image, but it turned out that there were a lot of triangles in the surrounding decorations besides the road signs. I changed the strategy to try to detect the red part of the picture. It is difficult to find the color range where the road sign is located during the detection process, so I try to adjust the color range to be searched so that there are as few objects other than road signs detected as possible. Then detect things in the shape of road signs in the detected content. In order to connect the road signs, I got the center point of each road sign and tried to connect those centerpoints, but the method I used was connecting the centerpoints of all signposts together, and not straight, but curved. I still haven't found a way to connect these points into a straight lineã€‚

## What I tried / What didn't work
I think the hardest part is how to correctly identify the red cone. During the recognition process, my code is constantly identifying other red objects in the picture, and other objects similar to cones other than the red cones that need to be identified. In addition, I failed to connect the cones into two lines. The method I used was wrong to connect the center points of all the cones. I couldn't find a way to connect the two lines of cones separately. 

## What Libraries I used
I used cv2 in python-opencv, numpy to solve parts involved array, matplotlib to process/plot the graphic version of the png image as well as imutils to solve the part involves contour.
